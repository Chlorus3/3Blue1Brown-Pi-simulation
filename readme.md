# A simulation of 3Blue1Brown's calculating Pi by collision puzzle

This is a simple program which simulates the collision between
2 cubes and shows how a cube with mass (100 ^ K) where K is a
whole number will collide with a cube with mass 1 and the amount 
of collisions will equal to the starting digits of Pi.
